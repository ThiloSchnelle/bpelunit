----------------------------------------------------------

= About the BPELUnit projects =


The BPELUnit project consists of several Eclipse projects. The actual code
is contained in the following six projects:

1) org.bpelunit.framework
	This is the main core of the framework and required by all other projects. It
	contains the abstract base runner, but does not contain any client.

2) org.bpelunit.client.ant
	The ant client.

3) org.bpelunit.client.command
	The command line client.

4) org.bpelunit.client.eclipse
	The Eclipse client.

5) org.bpelunit.toolsupport
	The Eclipse-based tool support.

6) org.bpelunit.oracleUnDeployer
	The UnDeployer for Oracle.

Three more projects contain scripts and other tools for building and documenting
the distributions.

1) org.bpelunit.build.eclipse
	The feature containing all necessary plugins for deploying BPELUnit into Eclipse,
	including tool support.
	
2) org.bpelunit.build.standalone
	A script for creating the standalone version of BPELUnit
	
3) org.bpelunit.documentation
	Contains meta-information about the BPELUnit project structure
	
= BUILDING =
	
1) STANDALONE

To build the standalone version, execute the build.xml script inside the project
"org.bpelunit.build.standalone". A "build" directory will be created, which can be copied
anywhere on the system to install BPELUnit.

2) ECLIPSE

To build the Eclipse version, you need to build both the Eclipse Feature and the Oracle
UnDeployer. 

* The Eclipse feature can be built using the Eclipse PDE tools (see feature.xml
  in the project "org.bpelunit.build.eclipse"), which will result in a JAR file for deployment
  into the Eclipse directory. 
  
* The Oracle UnDeployer can be built by executing the build.xml script inside the project 
  "org.bpelunit.oracleUnDeployer". A "build" directory will be created, which contains all
  necessary information to install the UnDeployer.
