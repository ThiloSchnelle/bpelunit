BPELUnit - A BPEL testing framework
http://www.se.uni-hannover.de/forschung/soa/bpelunit/

----------------------------------------------------------

This project belongs to the BPELUnit suite of tools and Eclipse plugins. Please
see the enclosed license file for licensing information.

----------------------------------------------------------

A note on building
-------------------

This project contains .java files, and .class files generated by Apache XMLBeans.
ALL (!) of these files are created by running the buildXMLModel.xml Ant build script.
Eclipse itself is NOT capable of generating the correct .class files for runtime,
so you need to ensure that the buildXMLModel.xml Ant script is executed EVERY
time the output folder has been cleared.


3rd party libraries
-------------------

The lib/ folder contains some 3rd-party JARs which are required by BPELUnit
to run. These JARs each have their own license, which are listed here. None
of these JARs has been modified in any way.
